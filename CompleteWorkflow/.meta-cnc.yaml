# type of skillet (panos or panorama or template or terraform)
type: workflow

# more complex skillets may express a dependency on another skillet that should be loaded before this one.
# For example, a set of skillets may build off of a single 'golden config' that contains shared configuration
# As this skillet is very simple, there is no need to build on another one.

# variables define the things an operator may customize in this skillet. Things like DNS servers, NTP addresses, etc
# may be customized for each deployment. Each variable will be rendered as a form field in the panhandler application

# Snippets is an ordered list of configuration xml fragments that will be pushed to the PAN-OS NGFW. The xpath
# determines where in the configuration hierarchy the xml fragment will be set. 'file' indicates the name of the file
# to load and parse. Jinja2 style variables will be variable interpolated using the values of the 'variables' defined
# in the 'variables' section.
